# 🔥 Smart Hybrid Eco Incineration Bin

## ♻️ Overview
The **Smart Hybrid Eco Incineration Bin** is a household-scale prototype designed to **burn waste efficiently**, **purify emitted smoke**, and **integrate microcontrollers for optimized control** — all managed through a **mobile application** made using Flutter.  
This project demonstrates the potential for an **eco-friendly, NodeMCU-powered waste management system** that is **safe**, **compact**, and **budget-friendly**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a **household incineration bin** that:
- Burns household waste efficiently.
- Purifies smoke before it is released.
- Uses microcontroller for automated safety and optimization.
- Is controlled remotely through a **mobile app**.

## ⚙️ Key Functions

### 🔸 1. Incineration Chamber
- Small, heat-resistant chamber (5–8 liters capacity).  
- Equipped with an **electric heating coil**.  
- Lined with **ceramic insulation** for heat retention.

### 🔸 2. Smoke Purification Unit
Two-stage filtering system:
1. **HEPA Filter** – traps fine particulates.  
2. **Activated Carbon Filter** – removes odor and toxic gases.  
- Includes a **small exhaust fan** to release purified air.

### 🔸 3. AI Integration
- Runs on **ESP8266 DEV**.  
- Features include:
  - Automatic heat level adjustment.
  - Smoke quality monitoring.

### 🔸 4. Mobile App Control
The mobile dashboard allows users to:
- Start / Stop incineration.  
- Control heat levels.  
- Set timers.  
- View chamber temperature.  
- Monitor smoke purification status.  
- Track process stages (**Heating → Incinerating → Complete**).  
- Receive notifications when it’s safe to open the bin.

### 🔸 5. Ash Tray
- **Removable tray** for collecting bottom ash.  
- Ash can be safely disposed of or reused in **construction materials**.

## 🧱 Prototype Materials

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Body** | Stainless steel mini bin |
| **Inner Lining** | Ceramic fiber or fireproof bricks |
| **Burner** | Electric coil or LPG burner (relay-controlled) |
| **Filters** | HEPA + Activated Carbon |
| **Sensors** | Thermocouple (temperature), Gas/smoke sensor |
| **Controller** | ESP8266 Dev + Wi-Fi |
| **Mobile App** | Minimal UI: Temperature, Status, Timer, Start/Stop |

## 🔄 Simplified Process Flow

1. User loads waste and closes the lid.  
2. Via mobile app, user presses **Start**.  
3. User sets desired **heat level** and **timer**.  
4. Waste incinerates; smoke passes through HEPA + carbon filters.  
5. Purified air is released.  
6. Mobile app notifies: **“Process Complete – Safe to Open.”**

---

## 💡 Why It’s Budget-Friendly
- Uses **2-stage filters** instead of multi-layer industrial units.  
- Relies on **basic, affordable sensors**.  
- Compact (5–8L) chamber design minimizes material cost.  
- Mobile app focuses only on **essential controls**.

---

## 🧩 Result
A **safe**, **affordable**, and **eco-conscious** prototype that demonstrates:
- 🔹 Efficient waste incineration  
- 🔹 Real-time monitoring  
- 🔹 Smoke purification  
- 🔹 Mobile app integration  

---

## 📱 Future Enhancements
- Multi-stage smoke purification system.  
- Solar-powered heating option.  
- Cloud data logging for performance tracking.
